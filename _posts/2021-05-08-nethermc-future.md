About NetherMC/ShadowCraft

Hello people, I havent been active in the Minecraft server hosting / developing community for a while now. This is because I have been busy on other projects and servers.

Today, I am excited to announce that NetherMC will be coming back.

There will be a whole new staff team and server, starting small but expanding as we go. 

The server will be built to withstand issues such as my budget via making it scalable both ways.

I want to tell you so much more, but not everything is finalised.

COMING NET 15/06

Welcome back o/
