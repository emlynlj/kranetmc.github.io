I have been working on the v0.2 update of NetherMC due to be released after initial release.

This is Dungeons. A crawler where you have to go through a Stronghold and kill creatures to get the Mystic Eye.

Without revealing so many secrets, I'll tell you some features.
 - Mysteries (puzzles and secret mobs/items)
 - The Inspector (a mini-boss)
 - The Portal (an area with hard puzzles and mobs)
 
Here's a picture. Hyperlinks don't want to work right now so youll have to copy it manually but ;/

I'll let you more know soon. Anyways, look forward to the release of the server soon!
